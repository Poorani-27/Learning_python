# Python Learning - Day 8 Progress

## Today's Focus: While Loop, Continue, and Break Statements

### Topics Covered:

1. **Introduction to While Loop:**
   - Explored the concept of a `while` loop in Python.
   - Understanding how a `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

2. **Syntax of While Loop:**
   - Learned the basic syntax for a `while` loop.
     ```python
     while condition:
         # Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
     ```

3. **Using the `continue` Statement:**
   - Introduced the `continue` statement to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration.
     ```python
     while condition:
         # Code to be executed
         if some_condition:
             continue
         # Code after continue will be skipped if some_condition is true
     ```

4. **Using the `break` Statement:**
   - Explored the `break` statement to exit the loop prematurely.
     ```python
     while condition:
         # Code to be executed
         if some_condition:
             break
         # Code after break will not be executed if some_condition is true
     ```

5. **Infinite Loops:**
   - Discussed the concept of infinite loops and how to avoid them.
     - Ensuring that the loop condition eventually becomes false.

6. **Examples of While Loop Usage:**
   - Explored practical examples of using `while` loops in different scenarios.
     - Iterating through a list, performing calculations, waiting for user input, etc.

7. **Nested While Loops:**
   - Learned about nesting `while` loops for more complex scenarios.
     ```python
     while condition1:
         while condition2:
             # Code to be executed
     ```
