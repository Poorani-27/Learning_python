# Logarithmic complexity

Logarithmic complexity, often denoted as O(log n), describes algorithms whose time or space requirements grow logarithmically with the size of the input data.

## Binary Search



Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the search interval is empty.

## Time Complexity
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the array. This means that the time taken by the algorithm grows logarithmically with the size of the input array.
