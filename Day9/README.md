# Python Learning - Day 9 Progress

## Today's Focus: Range, For Loop, and Nested For Loop

### Topics Covered:

1. **Introduction to Range:**
   - Explored the `range()` function in Python.
   - Understanding how `range()` generates a sequence of numbers that can be used in various loop scenarios.

2. **Using `range()` in For Loop:**
   - Learned how to use the `range()` function with a `for` loop.
     ```python
     for i in range(start, stop, step):
         # Code to be executed for each value of i
     ```

3. **Basic For Loop Syntax:**
   - Reviewed the basic syntax of a `for` loop in Python.
     ```python
     for variable in iterable:
         # Code to be executed for each item in the iterable
     ```

4. **Iterating Through Lists with For Loop:**
   - Practiced using `for` loops to iterate through lists and perform operations on each element.

5. **Using `enumerate()` with For Loop:**
   - Explored the `enumerate()` function to get both the index and the value from an iterable in a `for` loop.
     ```python
     for index, value in enumerate(iterable):
         # Code to be executed for each index-value pair
     ```

6. **Nested For Loops:**
   - Introduced the concept of nested `for` loops for handling two-dimensional data structures.
     ```python
     for i in range(rows):
         for j in range(columns):
             # Code to be executed for each (i, j) pair
     ```

7. **Looping Patterns:**
   - Explored common looping patterns, such as printing patterns using nested `for` loops.

8. **Using `break` and `continue` in For Loop:**
   - Reviewed how to use `break` and `continue` statements within `for` loops.

9. **List Comprehensions:**
   - Introduced list comprehensions as a concise way to create lists using a single line of code.

10. **Common Mistakes and Best Practices:**
