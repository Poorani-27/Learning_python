# Learning Python - Day 4

## Python Keywords

In Python, keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). Here's a list of some important Python keywords:

case sensitive

```python
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass       break
except     in         raise
```
# Getting User Input in Python


In Python programming, interacting with the user through input is a common task. 

## Basic Input

To receive a single input from the user, use the `input()` function:

# Getting Multiple Inputs in a Single Line in Python


The `input()` function can also be used to get multiple inputs separated by spaces. 

When working with Python, there are various scenarios where you might need to collect multiple inputs from the user in a single line.

## Using `split()` Method

The `split()` method is a handy way to separate multiple inputs entered in a single line.
