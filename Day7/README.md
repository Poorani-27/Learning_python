# Python Learning - Day 7 Progress

## Today's Focus: If Statements and Conditional Logic

### Topics Covered:

1. **Introduction to If Statements:**
   - Explored the fundamental concept of conditional statements in Python.
   - Understanding the need for conditional logic in programming.

2. **Syntax of If Statements:**
   - Learned the basic syntax for an `if` statement.
     ```python
     if condition:
         # Code to be executed if the condition is True
     ```

3. **Using `else` Statement:**
   - Expanded conditional logic with the `else` statement.
     ```python
     if condition:
         # Code to be executed if the condition is True
     else:
         # Code to be executed if the condition is False
     ```

4. **Using `elif` Statement:**
   - Introduced the `elif` (else if) statement for multiple conditions.
     ```python
     if condition1:
         # Code to be executed if condition1 is True
     elif condition2:
         # Code to be executed if condition2 is True
     else:
         # Code to be executed if all conditions are False
     ```

5. **Nested If Statements:**
   - Explored the concept of nesting `if` statements for more complex conditions.
     ```python
     if condition1:
         if condition2:
             # Code to be executed if both conditions are True
     ```

6. **Truthy and Falsy Values:**
   - Understanding how truthy and falsy values affect conditional statements.
     - In Python, empty objects, `0`, `None`, and `False` are considered falsy.

7. **Comparison Operators:**
   - Reviewed common comparison operators used in conditions.
     - Equal to (`==`), Not equal to (`!=`).
     - Greater than (`>`), Less than (`<`).
     - Greater than or equal to (`>=`), Less than or equal to (`<=`).

8. **Logical Operators with If Statements:**
   - Combined multiple conditions using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).

9. **Ternary Operator:**
   - Learned about the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
     ```python
     result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
     ```
