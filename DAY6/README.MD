# Python Learning - Day 6 Progress

## Today's Focus: Python Operations

### Topics Covered:

1. **Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Explored the fundamental arithmetic operations in Python.
     - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`).
     - Floor Division (`//`), Modulus (`%`), Exponentiation (`**`).

2. **Relational Operations:**
   - Learned about relational operations for comparisons.
     - Equal to (`==`), Not equal to (`!=`).
     - Greater than (`>`), Less than (`<`).
     - Greater than or equal to (`>=`), Less than or equal to (`<=`).

3. **Logical Operations:**
   - Introduced logical operations for combining conditions.
     - AND (`and`), OR (`or`), NOT (`not`).

4. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - Explored bitwise operations at the binary level.
     - Bitwise AND (`&`), Bitwise OR (`|`), Bitwise XOR (`^`).
     - Bitwise NOT (`~`), Left Shift (`<<`), Right Shift (`>>`).

5. **Assignment Operations:**
   - Understanding shorthand assignment operators.
     - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`.

6. **Identity Operations:**
   - Learned about identity operators for object comparison.
     - `is`, `is not`.

7. **Membership Operations:**
   - Explored membership operators to check for membership in a sequence.
     - `in`, `not in`.

8. **Order of Operations (Precedence):**
   - Discussed the order in which Python evaluates different operations.

9. **Math Library:**
   - Introduced the `math` library for advanced mathematical functions.
     - Examples: `math.sqrt()`, `math.sin()`, `math.cos()`.

10. **Numeric Type Conversion:**
    - Explored methods for converting between numeric types.
      - `int()`, `float()`, `complex()`.
